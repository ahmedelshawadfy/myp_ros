# Running ROS with MyP

On startup, the PRob will begin a roscore as well as a node which provides both the ROS communication and the browser based interface. Only one of these communication channels can be used to send commands to the robot at a time however after connecting over ROS, all outgoing information continues to be published their corresponding topics even after switching connections to the browser.

To use the same ROS Master as the PRob you must first have your machine appropriately set up for ROS network communication according to http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/NetworkSetup. You must then export the correct master URI. Open up a terminal and enter 

To open up all channels of communication over ROS, use the ROS service 'connect' provided by the PRob.

The first parameter must be a string, either 'real' or 'no_robot' depending on whether you want, the second is a string detailing your robot model, e.g 'PRob2R', the third parameter, also a string, determines the calibration type, which should always be 'default'.
